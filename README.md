
My single page angular app is a livescores web page.
It provides real time livescores for football matches around the world with fixtures, results and table standing for 8 of Europe’s top football divisions.
Also, any users or clients can contact me by filling an online form on the website to report any issues, suggestions...ect.
There is also an administrator’s portal on the page were an administrator can connect to see how many messages/requests we have received and with the clients details I can contact them.
An administrator can delete message permanently to clear the inbox and can also update a message if needed.
The requests sent are stored/hosted on Mango database, so once they are deleted, they are archived permanently.
I connect to Mango via a server that is store in a folder called Backend in the application.
An administrator can be deleted or created at the back end.
PS: To connect as an administrator use the username: martin and password: teacher
